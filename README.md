# 🛠️ real-life-issues

**Why not open-source your everyday problems?**  
Or your brilliant fixes (who are we kidding)?  
Welcome to **Real Life Issues** — a fun, community-driven GitHub project where your *real-life* headaches become *real-fun* discussions, and maybe even real solutions.

## 💡 What is this?

Think of this as an issue tracker for *life itself*.

Did your Wi-Fi stop working *only* when you're in the kitchen?  
Still can’t figure out how to politely leave Zoom calls?  
Have an unbeatable system for organizing your fridge?

This is the place to log those issues — and offer solutions. Let’s use the same tools we use for software to improve the offline parts of our lives too.

## 🧩 How it Works

1. **Raise an Issue:**  
   Open a GitHub Issue describing your real-world problem. Be as descriptive or chaotic as you like — just tag it with the appropriate category (or we'll help sort it out).

2. **Get Involved:**  
   See an issue that tickles your brain? Submit a Pull Request with a helpful suggestion, resource, guide, or even a hack.

3. **Just Vibes:**  
   No tests. No CI/CD. No merge conflicts. Just good ideas and a bit of wholesome internet chaos.

## 🎯 Why?

Because we’re curious.  
What problems do people face outside their IDE? Can we use the same collaborative spirit that powers open source to tackle those?  
Let’s find out. And have some laughs along the way.
